# Site Reliability Engineer Space

Welcome to the **SRE** repositoryâ€”a curated collection of hands-on labs, configurations, and documentation designed to explore and demonstrate various Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices. This project serves as a practical resource for learning and applying SRE principles in real-world scenarios.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following directories, each focusing on specific SRE-related topics:

### `aws-s3-cloudfront-rds-lambda`
